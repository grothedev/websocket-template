# websocket server for my home website

this application provides the websocket server for the home website. it used to be integrated within the same nodejs server that served the website, but now the website is served with laravel, so the websocet server shall be separate. 

currently the only thing it does is allow site visitors to see each other cursors on the page, along with an optional nametag.
